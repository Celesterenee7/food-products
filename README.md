## Description:
The concept for this project is to build a website for Mario's Specialty Food Products that will track unique visitors each day using the most comprehensive validations and callbacks to ensure information is properly saved and formatted in the database.

## User Stories:
* As a user, I should be able to add, update and delete products.
* As a user, I should be able to add reviews to existing products.
* As a user, I should be able to rate a product.
* As a user, I should be able to view all products from the USA as well as most recently added products.
